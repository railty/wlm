0. download freetds-1.3.12.tar.gz, configure, make and make install
make sure you can run tsql -S wm11162.local -U -P, and select name from sys.databases;
if not, change the "tds version = auto" to "tds version = 7.0" in freetds.conf
freetds.conf is not necessarily under /etc, run tsql -C to find the correct location
or set TDSVER=7.0 as ENV, this will make freetds work
also need to have "tds_version: 70" to make tiny-tds work
